\* common properties with shared property sets
\* common representations
\* common materials
\* common composition of elements
\* common ports

It is used to define a distribution board type specification indicating the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product type. The \*\*IfcDistributionBoardType\*\* may be declared within _IfcProject_ or _IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of \*\*IfcDistributionBoardType\*\* are represented by instances of _IfcDistributionBoard_. Refer to the documentation at _IfcDistributionBoard_ for supported property sets, materials, composition, and ports.
