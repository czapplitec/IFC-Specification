The _Surface Sectioned Geometry_ is the representation for elements having a 'Surface' representation, where the surface is specified using two or more open profiles that are swept between specified positions along the directrix, e.g. for defining the upper boundary of an _IfcCourse_.

The following attribute values for the _IfcShapeRepresentation_ holding this geometric representation shall be used:

* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._RepresentationIdentifier_ = 'Surface'
* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._RepresentationType_ = 'SectionedSurface'
* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._Items_ = _IfcSectionedSurface_
