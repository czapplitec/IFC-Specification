* built elements within a space separation systems
* built elements within an enclosure system (such as a facade)
* built elements within a fenestration system
* built elements within a load bearing system
* built elements within a foundation system

The IfcBuiltElement can be instantiated in the case when arbitrary built elements cannot be expressed by a subtype of IfcBuiltElement.
