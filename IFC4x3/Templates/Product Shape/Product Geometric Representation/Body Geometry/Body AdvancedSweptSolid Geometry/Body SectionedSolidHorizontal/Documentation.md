The _Body SectionedSolidHorizontal_ is the representation of the 3D body of a product by using two or more closed profiles, possibly with varying dimensions,  that are swept between specified positions along the directrix.

The following attribute values for the _IfcShapeRepresentation_ holding this geometric representation shall be used:

* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._RepresentationIdentifier_ = 'Body'
* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._RepresentationType_ = 'AdvancedSweptSolid'
* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._Items_ = _IfcSectionedSolidHorizontal_
