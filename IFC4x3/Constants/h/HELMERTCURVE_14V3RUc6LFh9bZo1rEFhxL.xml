	<Documentation>The Helmert curve or Helmert transition is an early example of a high performance transition bend. It is now widely accepted in relevant science and engineering that the linear change of the clothoid induces unwanted kinematic influences to a running train at speeds higher than 125 km/h.

In the geometry perspective the Helmert segment is the assembly of two parts of same length which mirror the same change in radius of curvature. A rough approximation is known as the biquadratic parabola.

&gt;NOTE&amp;nbsp; also referred to as Schramm curve.
