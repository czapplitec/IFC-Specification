An IfcAlignmentSegment is a segment of an IfcAlignment where either the vertical or horizontal direction or cant (in the case of trackdesign) obey a unique mathematical description as a function of the horizontal projection segment length of the alignment.

>NOTE 1 to entry: Unless otherwise stated, for railway, the appertaining track alignment design parameters are defined for the track center line.

>NOTE 2 to entry: For roads, the alignment typically describes the path of the road center line, but in certain situations, e.g. ramps, the alignment may describe the path of other edges of the road body
