	<Documentation>In IFC CUBIC denotes a transition segment where x and y coordinates obey a cubic formula.

It was discovered very early that setting **a** to &quot;1&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;6RL&quot; and **b**, **c** and **d** to 0 yields a good enough approximation of the clothoid in many situations.

&lt;br/&gt;

Since the manual computation of cubics was considerable easier compared to the theoretically sound clothoid, cubic transistions became very popular as &quot;good enough&quot; replacement curves.

Cubic transition bends can still be found in many legacy alignments based on earlier design regulations. There also exist regulations containing cubic transitions for new designs.

It is obvious that simple approximations cannot fulfil all requirements for a kinematically correct track design. For example, the requirement of tangential continuity has often been neglected in favour of lower design costs by using sufficiently good cubic curves.

The cubic is known in two variants as **Cubic Parabola** or **Cubic Spiral** setting either the sinus or the cosinus of the deflection angle to 0.
