	<Documentation>Sine transition or sinusoidal transition was suggested 1937. The curvature function is built up of one period of a sine function. The sine curve is characterised by particularly advantageous smoothing properties at the end points. Compared to the clothoid, it is twice as long.

&gt;NOTE&amp;nbsp; also referred to as Klein curve.
