FORMULAS: TO BE DONE

In the geometry perspective, it denotes a connection between two points where the y ordinate is a function of the cubic of the x ordinate. y = a x³. If the absolute value of the curvature is close to 0 the cubic is a good enough approximation of the kinematic properties of the clothoid.

In the kinematic perspective the curvature has to be calculated from the x,y ordinates.</Documentation>
